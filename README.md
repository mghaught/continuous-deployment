# Continous Deployment Scripts

This is a repository of various continuous deployment scripts for use in Ruby-based projects.  We'll first work with Integrity as add other continous integration solutions as we come across them. This is a work in project and we'll update this document with polished instructions on how to set this up once we're done.
